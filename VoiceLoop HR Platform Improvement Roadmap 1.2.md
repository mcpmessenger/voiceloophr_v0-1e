    *   **Details:** Investigate and implement streaming or chunk-based processing for large PDF files.
    *   **Priority:** Medium
    *   **Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks

### 2.2. Intelligent Content Analysis

*   **Task:** Integrate a dedicated NLP library (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) for entity extraction and language detection.
    *   **Details:** Replace current regex-based methods with more robust NLP models for higher accuracy.
    *   **Priority:** High
    *   **Estimated Effort:** 4 weeks
*   **Task:** Enable customizable entity extraction.
    *   **Details:** Allow users or developers to define custom entity patterns or provide external entity lists.
    *   **Priority:** Medium
    *   **Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks
*   **Task:** Refine contextual recommendations.
    *   **Details:** Make recommendations more specific and actionable by considering user roles, document purpose, and business rules.
    *   **Priority:** Medium
    *   **Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks

## Phase 3: Security & Maintainability (Weeks 13-20)

**Goal:** Strengthen security measures, ensure long-term maintainability, and prepare for future growth.

### 3.1. Advanced Security Scanning

*   **Task:** Implement dynamic pattern updates for `PII_PATTERNS`, `SENSITIVE_KEYWORDS`, and `COMPLIANCE_PATTERNS`.
    *   **Details:** Create a mechanism to update these patterns from external sources (e.g., configuration service, database).
    *   **Priority:** High
    *   **Estimated Effort:** 3 weeks
*   **Task:** Develop a system for managing false positives/negatives in security scanning.
    *   **Details:** Implement feedback loops, whitelisting/blacklisting, or machine learning models.
    *   **Priority:** Medium
    *   **Estimated Effort:** 3 weeks
*   **Task:** Explore integration with external security scanning tools.
    *   **Details:** Investigate SAST/DAST tools for automated vulnerability scanning.
    *   **Priority:** Low
    *   **Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks

### 3.2. Project Configuration & Deployment
