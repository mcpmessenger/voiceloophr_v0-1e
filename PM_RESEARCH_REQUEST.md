# PM Research Request: PDF Parsing Solutions for VoiceLoop HR

## 📋 **Research Objective**
Evaluate and recommend the most robust, cost-effective PDF parsing solution for VoiceLoop HR platform to replace current problematic implementation.

## 🎯 **Current Situation Analysis**

### **Problem Statement**
- Current PDF parsing is producing garbled text output
- Processing method shows "textract" instead of intended "pdf-parse"
- Fallback to hybrid processor is not working reliably
- User experience is poor with unreadable extracted content

### **Current Implementation Issues**
1. **Text Extraction Quality**: Output contains encoded characters and binary data
2. **Processing Method Confusion**: System falls back to AWS Textract instead of direct extraction
3. **Reliability Problems**: Inconsistent results across different PDF types
4. **User Experience**: Poor content quality in results display

## 🔍 **Research Requirements**

### **Primary Research Areas**

#### **1. PDF Parsing Libraries & Solutions**
**Objective**: Identify the most reliable PDF text extraction libraries

**Research Questions**:
- What are the top 5 PDF parsing libraries for Node.js/JavaScript?
- How do they compare in terms of accuracy, speed, and reliability?
- What are their limitations and edge cases?
- What is the cost structure for each solution?

**Solutions to Evaluate**:
- `pdf-parse` (current attempt - problematic)
- `pdf2pic` + OCR
- `pdf-lib` + text extraction
- `pdfjs-dist` (PDF.js)
- `mammoth` (for DOCX conversion to PDF)
- `tesseract.js` (OCR-based)
- Commercial APIs (AWS Textract, Google Vision, Azure Computer Vision)

#### **2. Hybrid Processing Strategies**
**Objective**: Design a robust fallback system

**Research Questions**:
- What is the optimal processing pipeline for different PDF types?
- How should we handle PDFs with embedded text vs. scanned images?

#### **3. Cost-Benefit Analysis**
**Objective**: Evaluate total cost of ownership

**Research Questions**:
- What are the processing costs per document for each solution?
- How do accuracy rates affect downstream AI processing costs?
- What are the infrastructure and maintenance costs?
- What is the ROI of different solutions for our use case?

#### **4. Technical Architecture**
**Objective**: Design optimal system architecture

**Research Questions**:
- Should we use client-side or server-side processing?
