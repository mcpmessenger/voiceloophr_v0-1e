# PDF Library Research Notes

## Research Objective
Evaluate Node.js-compatible PDF parsing libraries to identify the most suitable one for robust text and metadata extraction from various PDF types (digital, scanned).

## Current Libraries in Use
- `pdf-lib` (v1.17.1) - PDF manipulation and metadata
- `pdf-parse` (v1.1.1) - Text extraction
- `tesseract.js` (v6.0.1) - OCR for scanned documents

## Library Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Performance
- Processing speed for various file sizes
- Memory usage efficiency
- Scalability for batch processing

### 2. Feature Completeness
- Text extraction accuracy
- Metadata extraction capabilities
- OCR integration support
- Error handling robustness

### 3. Maintenance & Community
- Active development status
- Bug fix frequency
- Community support quality
- Documentation completeness

### 4. Compatibility
- Node.js version support
- TypeScript support
- Browser compatibility (if needed)

## Library Analysis

### pdf-parse (Current)
**Pros:**
- Simple API
- Good text extraction for digital PDFs
- Lightweight

**Cons:**
- Limited metadata extraction
- No OCR capabilities
- Basic error handling
- Version 1.1.1 (may have stability issues)

**Verdict:** Keep as fallback, but needs enhancement

### pdf-lib (Current)
**Pros:**
- Excellent metadata manipulation
- PDF creation and modification
- Active development

**Cons:**
- Limited text extraction
- Not designed for content parsing
- Higher memory usage

**Verdict:** Keep for metadata, not for text extraction

### tesseract.js (Current)
**Pros:**
- Excellent OCR capabilities
- Multiple language support
- Active development

**Cons:**
- High memory usage
- Slower processing
- Requires image conversion

**Verdict:** Keep for OCR, optimize usage

## Alternative Libraries to Research

### 1. pdf2pic
**Purpose:** Convert PDF pages to images
**Use Case:** Pre-processing for OCR
**Research Status:** Pending

### 2. pdfjs-dist
**Purpose:** Mozilla's PDF.js for Node.js
**Use Case:** Comprehensive PDF parsing
**Research Status:** Pending

### 3. hummus-recipe
**Purpose:** PDF manipulation and text extraction
**Use Case:** Alternative to pdf-lib
**Research Status:** Pending

### 4. node-poppler
**Purpose:** Poppler-based PDF processing
**Use Case:** High-quality text extraction
**Research Status:** Pending

## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Benchmark Current Libraries
- [ ] Test text extraction accuracy with sample PDFs
- [ ] Measure processing time for 1MB, 10MB, 50MB files
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during processing
- [ ] Test error handling with corrupted files

### Task 2: Research Alternative Libraries
- [ ] Investigate pdf2pic for page-to-image conversion
- [ ] Evaluate pdfjs-dist for comprehensive parsing
- [ ] Research hummus-recipe capabilities
- [ ] Check node-poppler availability and performance

### Task 3: Integration Strategy
- [ ] Design hybrid approach using best features from each library
- [ ] Plan fallback chain for different PDF types
- [ ] Consider memory optimization strategies
- [ ] Plan error handling improvements

## Sample PDFs for Testing

### Digital PDFs
- [ ] Simple text document (1-2 pages)
- [ ] Complex formatted document (10+ pages)
- [ ] Document with tables and images
- [ ] Multi-language document

### Scanned PDFs
- [ ] High-quality scan (300 DPI)
- [ ] Low-quality scan (150 DPI)
- [ ] Mixed digital/scanned content
- [ ] Handwritten content

### Problematic PDFs
- [ ] Corrupted files
- [ ] Password-protected files
- [ ] Very large files (>50MB)
- [ ] Files with complex layouts

## Performance Benchmarks

### Target Metrics
- **Processing Speed**: <30 seconds for 10MB files
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB per document
- **Accuracy**: >90% text extraction for digital PDFs
- **OCR Accuracy**: >80% for scanned documents

### Benchmark Results
*To be filled during testing*

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Week 1)
1. Enhance current `pdf-parse` implementation
2. Optimize `tesseract.js` usage
3. Implement better error handling

### Medium-term (Week 2-3)
1. Research and test alternative libraries
2. Implement hybrid approach
3. Add comprehensive testing

### Long-term (Phase 2)
1. Evaluate commercial PDF services
2. Consider custom PDF processing pipeline
3. Implement advanced OCR features

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Begin benchmarking current libraries
2. **This Week**: Research alternative libraries
3. **Next Week**: Implement improvements based on findings
