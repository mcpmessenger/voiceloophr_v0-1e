# Document Visibility and Processing Controls

## Current Document Visibility Status

### Development Environment
**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Documents are currently publicly accessible in development**

In the current development setup:

1. **Guest Mode**: Documents are stored in browser localStorage - only visible to that specific browser session
2. **No Authentication Required**: The app works without registration, so anyone can upload and access documents
3. **Global Storage**: Documents are stored in server memory (`global.uploadedFiles`) which is shared across all users
4. **No Access Control**: There's no user-based access control implemented yet

### Storage Locations
- **Server Memory**: `global.uploadedFiles` Map (shared across all users)
- **Browser localStorage**: `voiceloop_uploaded_files` (user-specific)
- **Database**: Supabase `documents` table (if configured)

### Security Implications
- ‚úÖ **Fine for testing**: Current setup is appropriate for development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not production-ready**: Need authentication and access controls before production
- üîí **Future needs**: User authentication, document ownership, access permissions

## New Processing Controls Added

### 1. Stop Processing API
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/process/stop`

**Features**:
- Stops ongoing document processing
- Updates document status to 'cancelled'
- Cleans up processing state
- Provides detailed error handling

**Usage**:
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/process/stop', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ fileId: 'document-id' })
})
```

### 2. Enhanced Delete Functionality
**Enhanced**: `DELETE /api/documents/[id]`

**New Features**:
- Automatically stops processing before deletion
- Cleans up RAG data (embeddings and chunks)
- Removes from global storage
- Comprehensive cleanup across all storage locations

### 3. UI Controls Added

#### Upload Page
- ‚úÖ **Cancel Button**: Already existed for processing files
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced**: Now calls server-side stop API
- ‚úÖ **Visual Feedback**: Shows "Cancelled" status

#### Dashboard Page
- ‚úÖ **Stop Processing Button**: New button for documents in processing state
- ‚úÖ **Visual States**: Shows "Stopping..." during operation
- ‚úÖ **Status Updates**: Real-time status updates

### 4. Processing States
**Available States**:
- `uploading`: File being uploaded
- `processing`: AI/text extraction in progress
- `completed`: Processing finished successfully
- `cancelled`: Processing stopped by user
- `error`: Processing failed

## Usage Examples

### Stop Processing from Dashboard
1. Navigate to Dashboard
2. Find document with "Processing..." status
3. Click "Stop Processing" button
4. Document status changes to "Cancelled"

### Delete Processing Document
1. Click delete button (trash icon) on any document
2. System automatically stops processing if needed
3. Comprehensive cleanup performed
4. Document removed from all storage locations

### Cancel During Upload
1. Upload page shows "Cancel" button during processing
2. Click to stop processing immediately
3. File status updates to "Cancelled"

## Technical Implementation

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/process/stop` - Stop document processing
- `DELETE /api/documents/[id]` - Enhanced delete with processing cleanup

### State Management
- Global storage updates
- localStorage synchronization
- UI state management
- Error handling and user feedback

### Cleanup Process
1. Stop any ongoing processing
2. Remove from global storage
3. Clean up RAG embeddings
4. Remove from database
5. Clear localStorage
6. Update UI state

## Future Enhancements Needed

### Security & Access Control
- [ ] User authentication system
- [ ] Document ownership tracking
- [ ] Access permission controls
- [ ] Private document storage

### Processing Improvements
- [ ] Background job queue
- [ ] Processing progress tracking
- [ ] Batch processing controls
- [ ] Processing history

### User Experience
- [ ] Better progress indicators
- [ ] Processing time estimates
- [ ] Bulk operations
- [ ] Processing notifications

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload Test**: Upload a large PDF and test stop functionality
2. **Dashboard Test**: Check processing documents show stop button
3. **Delete Test**: Delete processing documents to verify cleanup
4. **Error Handling**: Test with network issues and API failures
5. **State Persistence**: Refresh page and verify states persist

## Production Readiness Checklist

- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add document ownership
- [ ] Implement access controls
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement proper error logging
- [ ] Add monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Test with production data volumes
- [ ] Implement backup and recovery
